Welcome to my portfolio!
==========================

This portfolio is created by me, Nadja Spångberg as a project in the course PA1436 -Technical web design and usability.

About me:

My name is Nadja Spångberg I am 32 years old and I live in Värmdö with my fiancé, son and Dog. I love to develop and learn new things. However, it doesn't usually stop there, I allways like to understand how things work throughout in detail.

The need to create has always been present in my life and at least one project is in running at home. The current project to renovate an old house is nearing its end and the doors have now been opened for a new one: Web-programming!

Problem solving is something that I love, regardless of level. Maybe it has to do with my stubborn side or it is the feeling that you both learn new things and solve the problem that is appealing to me. The sentence "It doesn't work" is not in my vocabulary. Then I rather think that the path to the solution just wasn't correct.

One goal in life is to be able to conduct business from home digitally together with my fiancé. Since neither of us nor anyone close to us had the knowledge to create these conditions, I chose to now take matters into my own hands.


conomics, retail, colours, administration and animal care are some of several previous areas of work.
