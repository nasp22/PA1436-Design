About this website!
==========================

![about](%assets_url%/img/about.jpg){.about}


This webside is build and based on a framework called Pico. Pico , that is a CMS (Content Management System). Pico allows me to work with Markdowns-files for content and Twig for the layout. Both converts to html and makes it easy for anyone to apply content and styling to a website. Css together with Scss/Sass is used to style the website. This makes it easy to change color-theme and controle the entire design with small efforts. The use of variables makes it easy to change the entire color-theme For example, on this website the base-colors wich are called color1, color2, color3 and color4.
